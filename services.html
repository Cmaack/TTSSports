        <p class="section-paragraph">Time to Sign’s concepts and approaches are <strong>unique</strong>, <strong>proven</strong>  and <strong>effective</strong>. Most importantly, we have found that exceptional communication is our premier asset. Personal communication is critical.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Our exclusive Student-Athlete Correlation Score™ (SCS™) is a critical component in the recruiting process. The SCS™ allows us to compare a player’s abilities against other players and in relation to individual college requirements. Using a well conceived formula, we evaluate the student-athlete on 30 core factors (10 athletic skills, 10 sport-related skills, and 10 critical academic factors). The compilation of our findings enables us to determine an appropriate list of colleges to consider for each student-athlete. It is this process that has allowed Time to Sign Sports to become so successful in an industry that has often been an inexact science.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">Time to Sign Sports’ attention to detail keeps you on the radar screens of many colleges. Everything is done professionally, timely, and ethically. Time to Sign Sports has developed the roadmap to success – helping you reach the goal of playing ball in college.</p>
        <p class="section-paragraph">The college community considers us a valuable and unbiased referral for talent - affording us the opportunity to open more doors for you to colleges across the country. All the members on our team share this same vision.</p>

                We will NOT negotiate the offer that is made.  The offer to play ball and enroll in any school is between the student-athlete, the school, and the school's coaching staff and admissions office. While we will offer advice and counsel about the various venues and events to attend, the types of exposure tournaments to participate in, the focus on various academic components, and other topics, the "selling" of the student-athete is the responsibility of the student-athlete.  With our guidance and support, we feel confident that our student-athletes will receive an offer to continue playing ball in college at a school that matches both their academic standing and the athletic/sport skill level.

                We have developed a scoring system that factors in over 30 variables related to your academics, athleticism, and skill in your sport.  These variables are computed using a proprietary formula to determine your Student Correlation Score (SCS).  We have likewise assigned an SCS to Division I, II, and III programs across the country.  The intersection of the school and your SCS helps us arrive at an appropriate starting list of schools to focus our attention.

The preferred method of payment is Credit/Debit Card, but we will gladly accept checks as well.  We do NOT charge an annual fee.  While our showcase events are not mandatory for you to attend, your participation is strongly encouraged as it keeps you exposed on on the stage for colleges to see your game.

                We constantly communicate with college coaches throughout the country.  Understanding the specific needs a coach has for each recruiting class enables us to target our approach and gear our efforts in the best and most efficient way.  We will help get your name on the radar screen of the appropriate schools based on the SCS evaluation.  At the end of the day, YOU will be the one to earn a roster spot.  YOU will need to have the scholastic achievement to qualify for the school.  YOU will have to impress the coach with your ball playing abilities.  Our goal is to make sure we get you in front of the “right” coaches often enough so that you can garner their interest and attract an offer.

                Money is Money.  Keep your eye on the ball and the ultimate goal. The most coveted prize in the recruiting process is being offered a roster spot on the baseball, softball, or soccer team respectively.  Academics become a critical component of the scholarship process because if a school has no “sport specific” money left for athletic scholarships, they can seek academic money, grants, and scholarships.  Likewise, your financial situation may also dictate the level at which financial aid becomes a real factor in the equation.

Before jumping to any conclusions of what is “good” or “bad”, let our experts determine what the next steps are.
