Playing for Time to Sign Sports this summer gave me the opportunity to visit over 30 schools, in over 12 different states, and play in front of college coaches of all levels. It gave me a good idea of what playing baseball at the next level would be." - Josh Barditch || "The Time to Sign summer showcase program was an extremely well-oiled machine. Berg and the staff were very professional and organized. The selection of tournaments and college visits, even hotels, were excellent. We appreciate the guidance both on and off the field."</p>

More than that, they are truly committed to the entire recruiting process which includes advising student-athletes that playing college baseball is a lot more than signing the letter of intent.

Thanks to Mark who saw Joey at a showcase, recognizing his talent, and made the contact, spending much time on the phone with us to encourage us to sign with TTS. A special thanks to Sam who worked with Joey for many hours on his hitting, giving him the confidence he needed to enter the summer season, and to you Berg, who did the leg work, using your experience and contacts to set us up with the school that would be a perfect fit for Joey!

Unless your son is among the top 100 baseball players in the country, I would highly recommend using Time to Sign Sports. We knew that we could not just sit back and hope that coaches would be calling our son, Jake. Hope is not a strategy. We came to realize that we needed to take an aggressive approach to recruiting and college selection and entrusted Berg Ohanian and his staff to help Jake match up his athletic tools and skills with the needs of a particular baseball program. The Time to Sign Sports staff assisted Jake in developing a list of schools, Divisions 1-3, and guided him with appropriate and timely communications to college coaches. Over the course of several months, with guidance from Time to Sign Sports, Jake would edit his list based on a variety of things such as geographic preferences, number of players already committed for his position, opportunities for him to fit in with a specific baseball program and last, but definitely not least, the school’s academic programs offered. Today, Jake could not be more excited and blessed to have verbally committed to Marist College!

Working with Coach Snusz and meeting Berg from TTS Sports was huge for me. They both helped get me in contact with a bunch of coaches and potential college fits. Fortunately I played well in front of a couple coaches down there and generated some good interest. Pretty soon afterward I visited the University of Oklahoma and took part in a camp down there. Meeting and getting to know the coaching staff and some of the players, as well as see the facilities made it a really easy decision for me...In the end I could not have been blessed with a better situation for me, my family, and my developement as a baseball player and human being.

Their integrity, knowledge, reputation and contacts are impressive, as is the care they take to get to know families and guide them appropriately.  Their individualized support is the antithesis of all the cookie-cutter recruiting services.  TTSS is the most sensible way to go because they offer so much more: more honest feedback, more opportunities to be seen, more colleges interested. Our son enjoyed playing on Time To Sign’s summer and fall teams.  Every teammate was intent on playing college ball.  Every workout and game drew college coaches who came to consider players for their rosters and to recommend players to their colleagues at other colleges.  Every player was treated respectfully.  Sam did a great job managing the team and every team communication was straightforward, concise and accurate. We are extremely appreciative to have Time To Sign in our lives."</p>

            <p id="case-6">"We joined Time to Sign in the spring of 2014.  At the time our son, Roberto, was pitching very well for his HS Team.  His high school, though a very good school, was not widely-recognized for baseball and so our son was virtually invisible to the College Recruiters.  We just didn't realize it.  We didn't know enough about the recruiting industry or how to get Rob recruited.  We put up a web page with minimal results. We put him into a showcase, also with minimal results.   We got a lot of advice from well-meaning friends and family.  We heard some interesting promises and tales from people in the industry.   Nothing really helped us get Rob where he needed to be - until we met Sam &amp; Berg @ Time to Sign Sports.  They came to one of Rob's game's, measured his performance and within hours had helped us understand Rob's potential  and the level of school that we could target.  They also helped us understand why we were struggling with marketing.  Within a few days after that, Time to Sign came to our home and laid out their entire methodology and program including their summer and fall schedule.    Their program was more than just a series a games.  It was an elevator.  It exposed Rob to a wide range of people and collegiate facilities that would never have happened otherwise.   He traveled extensively, pitched against more competitive teams and in front of hundreds of recruiters - only this time, thanks to Berg and his team, these recruiters knew who Rob was.  Although we could not follow him everywhere, Rob's family did go on several trips with him and came away with awesome memories.  Long story short, Rob committed to Post and we have Rob's hard work and Time to Sign to thank.   One last thing, this kind of growth experience does not come cheap and I know it wasn't easy for us to generate the funds, but I can tell you that every dollar was worth it.  It was not just about college recruitment for us - it was Rob’s journey.  We watched our son learn what it means to sacrifice and work hard to achieve your goals.  We watched him learn through all the travel and game experiences.  We watched him mature right before our eyes… and the moment the offer letter arrived was simply priceless.  If you have the means, I enthusiastically recommend the Time to Sign Baseball Program."</p>

            <p id="case-54">"Our son had a strong summer this year and was fortunate to get a lot of attention and interest. With that said, we still needed help to navigate through the recruiting process and reached out to Berg, who we have known for many years as a reputable person in the baseball industry. We decided to attend a Time To Sign Sports Showcase, and simply put, it was a who's who of colleges in attendance. Their relationships with the coaches was unbelievable, and Joseph was able to get the exposure he needed, and eventually commit to San Jacinto. We are glad that we had Time To Sign Sports in our corner to help us sort through everything to make an informed decision. Anyone seriously thinking of playing ball in college MUST involve these guys. Thank you Berg and Time to Sign Sports! Keep doing what you do!"</p>

We heard a lot of feedback on what you 'should' do to make it happen, but there never seemed to be a logical approach. We were inundated with emails requesting his attendance at baseball showcases and college camps all over the country.  We soon came to find out that we needed help.  Time to Sign Sports provided my son and our family guidance through a process that was focused on both his athletic and strong academic abilities.  They understood the parental and student concerns throughout the process since they recently went through it with their own sons.  Time to Sign Sports helped open doors at schools that were a fit.  Our money was spent wisely instead of tossing it into the wind  which is how we felt before signing on with them. Berg  took a real world approach to our situation that made sense. I genuinely feel these doors would not have been opened without their many reputable contacts who respect their opinion.  Multiple coaches opened conversations with us stating 'Berg thinks very highly of your son'  or 'Berg thinks your son will be a good fit for our program'.  Ultimately, your student athlete has to perform and convey their own message of success to the coach that’s in the recruiting seat.  That is life and what will determine their own success in their future.  Having the opportunity to be in the position to do so was presented by a partnership with Time to Sign that helped make it happen!"</p>

Being showcased in front of some of the best baseball programs and their coaches made a huge difference for me. Time to Sign Sports looked for schools with strong baseball programs and that took my academic major into consideration.
                              They called many schools on my behalf and I received five different offers. Their established connections are many and far reaching.
                              Thank you so very much for helping me find the perfect college that is going to give me an opportunity to continue playing the game that I love while continuing my education and furthering my degree.
                              You've taken a huge burden off my shoulders and for that, I am grateful."</p>

            <p id="case-23">"When we began working with Time to Sign Sports, we were fortunate that our son, Jake, already had a couple of offers to play ball in college. The advice and counsel we received from Berg helped in our decision process. Their first class and highly recruited exposure events offered our son a stage to showcase his skills to so many schools. Because of the Time to Sign Sports workout we attended, the interest level and the offers Jake received was almost overwhelming. In the end, with Berg and the entire Time to Sign Sports team on our side, we were able to weigh all the pros and cons and help our son make the most important decision of his life. Go Wildcats. Thanks guys!"</p>

            <p id="case-58">"I got introduced to TTS and Berg after my son had already received his first D1 offer with a few more expected to come.  Naturally, I debated whether another investment made sense since we all know how financially draining travel ball is.  Choosing to move forward with Berg and his team proved to be one of the best decisions I made throughout this crazy process.  After my first conversation with Berg, I could easily notice the passion for what he does and his connections with college coaches. I appreciated his honestly with both myself and my son throughout the process regarding where he felt he may succeed as well as what coaches thought about his performance and projectability.  As our process progressed together, business was still business but there was an obvious friendship between us.  In the end, my son Zach received many more D1 offers, from different conferences, different financial packages, many from schools that were not even on our radar.  Zach choose the best college for him that checked as many boxes off his list.  Berg accomplished more in 4 months than any travel organization has for my son since his journey began at 7 years old.”</p>

With the help of such a professional staff, Sam, Mark, Berg and his team, Michael has been given the chance to play Division I baseball at Wagner College. The TTS family welcomed us in, took care of our son, and helped expose him to multiple college coaches at the best tournaments.  Without the help of everyone at the TTS team, Michael would not be where he is today. Our experience with this program was so positive that we have no regrets. I would recommend everyone to join this program just as we did!  Thank you again for all your tremendous efforts and we are forever grateful! Go Seahawks!!!"</p>

Their priorities were always in the right place - academics first combined with a pragmatic baseball developmental plan. Berg showed a commitment and belief in Chase that we will always be indebted to him. Berg's passion, work ethic and experience within the recruiting process is spot on. The combination of Berg and Sam's skills and guidance was a great fit.  Berg and Sam's dedication and honesty throughout the process was never less than a 100%. Berg treated, guided and supported Chase like his own son.  Chase is very honored and excited about his commitment to play at Wake Forest. Time to Sign Sports was a key component in providing this great opportunity. I am pleased to have my 2nd son Reed join the TTS team and my 3rd son Cole is not far away. Sam and Berg have already started the process. Berg ....... A special thank you for who you are and your commitment to provide a correct recruiting and life changing experience for Chase."</p>

            <p id="case-59">The Peiffer family would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Time to Sign Sports for all they’ve done to assist us through the baseball recruiting process. We couldn’t have done it without you guys! We had no idea how to manage Dylan’s dream of playing baseball at the college level and how to make it a reality. Choosing a college without adding the baseball component is difficult enough! TTSS and Berg have developed relationships and have a very good reputation with numerous college coaches. Coaches couldn't say enough about Berg and the TTSS program. The system they have designed works! Dylan had several options and found his best fit because of the TTSS staff. He is ecstatic to be attending Widener University and getting started with their baseball program this fall.
                            We consider Berg, Sam, Mark and the entire Time to Sign Sports staff part of our extended family. Dylan feels he learned even more about positive motivation and how to develop team chemistry from the staff which is a valuable skill in the game of baseball. Dylan constantly refers to his TTSS team and how much he loved playing with and traveling with the team. He really misses everyone. He’s had a passion for playing baseball his entire life and this is by far his most enjoyable baseball experience.
                            The Peiffer family highly recommends this program to anyone interested in playing college baseball at the next level. Best Wishes to our Time to Sign family and friends.</p>

            <p id="case-59">"My name is Ed Taylor. My wife Mary and I, noticed long ago that our son, Brennan had a proclivity towards baseball. More than likely, you came to the same conclusion with your son. Brennan played several years for renowned AAU team in South Jersey. He enjoyed his time there, as we did. They provided him with baseball knowledge and he did play baseball at a higher level than we could have provided him locally. As Brennan got older plans for college became more imminent. As I said, his AAU team provided him with great baseball experiences but, one thing they did not provide was exposure to college coaches. His junior year was upcoming and we knew we had to make a change . In the summer of 2013, I received an email from Time to Sign about a camp they were going to hold in September. I am sure your son receives dozens of invites to camps and showcases. The name of the program ; "Time to Sign" intrigued me. Given our state of desperation; due to the fact that we were not getting any assistance from avenues that we had previously put our faith in . I took him up to a Time to Sign camp in Saddle River, New Jersey and immediately Brennan was on the radar with 3 colleges. Berg and Sam stayed in touch with us, and more importantly, with Brennan throughout the year. We were so impressed with their approach, and so hopeful that they could help, that we signed Brennan up to tour with Time to sign in the summer of 2014 . By the end of it he had a minimum of 10 colleges bidding for him. We went from being beggars to choosers. We went from; "will he play in college" to; "where will he play in college ". My wife and I were actually able to make several of the games. One thing that came quite apparent was that Berg did not have to seek out coaches. They came to him! Berg knows everyone and everyone knows Berg . Our son will be playing for Widener for the next four years. Berg, Sam and the rest of the Time to Sign staff were instrumental in that."</p>
